# Contributing Guidelines

What's the purpose of this project?
------------------------------------
This is just a simple game that will give someone new to Linux a taste of what working on the command line is like. It's interactive and introduces the concept of man pages, teaching some basic commands.

How can I contribute?
---------------------
Any way you like! From small changes to adding a whole new section of the game. When contributing please do your best to adhere to the same style as the rest of the project. There's a few guidelines below:
* Each section should have an accompanying command that needs to be 'chosen' from the set. Commands should only be used once. For example, you would have 'complete task a' and then add a corresponding 'man page command a'. Do not give prompts with the answer within the game text itself, that defeats the purpose!
* Stick to either real commands, or commands that use industry standard vocabulary. e.g. 'bruteforce' is not a command, but bruteforce is a valid industry term.
* Tone should match that of the rest of the game, feel free to pop in plenty of popular references!
* If you'd like to start a whole new scenario off, that would also be neat. It would be fun to have multiple different game scenarios available eventually.

Can I clone the repo and spin off my own version?
--------------------------------------------------
Absolutely! If you like the idea but hate the tone it's written in, or would like to change the scenario up feel free to take the base code and do what you like with it. 

I've found a bug
